gives AI immediate context on how to replicate such style consistently. It should NOT include specific instance-by-instance data, but a broad overview of how to generate content in this style.\n\nPROFILE STRUCTURE\n\nThe JSON should include detailed specifications for:\n\n1. COLOR SYSTEM\n- Primary color palette (hex codes, RGB, HSL)\n- Secondary/accent colors\n- Color temperature (warm/cool)\n- Saturation levels (high/low/medium)\n- Contrast ratios\n- Color application patterns\n\n2. TYPOGRAPHY\n- Font families (primary, secondary, accent)\n- Font weights used\n- Font sizes and hierarchy\n- Text alignment patterns\n- Text effects (shadows, outlines, etc.)\n- Readability considerations\n\n3. COMPOSITION & LAYOUT\n- Element placement patterns\n- Rule of thirds application\n- Symmetry vs. asymmetry\n- White space usage\n- Focal point strategies\n- Layering techniques\n\n4. VISUAL ELEMENTS\n- Icon style (flat, 3D, outlined, filled)\n- Image treatment (filters, overlays, borders)\n- Background patterns\n- Texture usage\n- Graphic elements (shapes, lines, decorative)\n- Branding elements placement\n\n5. CONTRAST & DEPTH\n- Contrast level (high/medium/low)\n- Shadow usage (depth, direction, intensity)\n- Highlight techniques\n- 3D effects or flat design\n- Depth layering\n\n6. STYLE CHARACTERISTICS\n- Overall aesthetic (modern, retro, minimalist, maximalist, etc.)\n- Emotional tone (energetic, calm, professional, playful)\n- Industry alignment\n- Target audience considerations\n\n7. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n- Dimensions and aspect ratios\n- Resolution requirements\n- File format preferences\n- Export settings\n\nSOURCE INPUT\n{{source_description}}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn a complete, well-structured JSON object that an AI can use to replicate this style consistently. Include:\n- Clear key-value pairs\n- Nested objects for complex specifications\n- Arrays for multiple options\n- Comments explaining style decisions\n- Example use cases\n\nThe profile should be comprehensive enough that an AI can generate new content in this exact style without seeing the original examples.'}];var s,l,c,d,m,p,u=t(7528),g=t(5464);const h=g.Ay.div(s||(s=(0,u.A)(["\n  position:
